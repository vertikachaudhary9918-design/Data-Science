Sales and Growth Dashboard Overview
The Sales and Growth Dashboard is an advanced, dynamic solution designed to provide a focused view of performance and insights metrics for the top master brokers based on user selection.
There are 2 different views Insights and performance and the user can toggle by clicking on the button.

It ensures accuracy and consistency by reconciling data directly from SQL tables, using queries that mimic the exact structure of the dashboard tables.
I have added the SQL queries for retrieving the tables for Standard view in SQL/project/Sales & Growth for the reference. 
(Please note I cannot attach the organization's data in order to compliance with regulations like GDPR)

Key Features:

Top Master Brokers Selection:
Displays the top brokers based on user-defined criteria (e.g., premium, policy count, or growth).
Sorting options include:

1. Direction Premium
2. Written Policy Counts
3. Growth



Dynamic Filtering Across Tables:
The dashboard doesn’t just filter the master broker table, it dynamically updates:

1. Transaction Type Table (built from scratch using complex DAX measures)
2. Line of Business Table
3. Existing Business Data Table
4. New Business Data Table
5. Broker Segment
6. Broker Type
7. Top MasterBrokers Table
8. KPI Cards that shows year selected and previous year same period data, along with growth rate.
9. Total Amount (combined view of New business and Existing Business)

Business performance view:
Consists of transaction type, Line of business, KPI cards, top master brokers tables and visuals.


Business Insights view:
Broker segmentation, broker type,Existing Business, New Business, and Total Amount (combined view of both) are displayed in the Insights section.
Totals represent overall performance across Top N brokers. There is deep diving of broker data further into segments and type in this view. 



Advanced Sorting & Analysis:
Users can sort by multiple metrics (premium, policy count, growth) for deeper insights.


Dedicated Panel & Banner:
A dedicated panel has been added for better space utilization, with a banner at the top for quick navigation and branding.



Data Accuracy & SQL Reconciliation:
To ensure no compromise in data integrity, the dashboard is reconciled directly with SQL tables:

Custom SQL Queries replicate the exact logic used in the dashboard tables (e.g., Transaction Type Table,etc).
Sample queries for sorting by Direction Premium are stored in the Sales & Growth SQL folder as templates for reference.
These queries demonstrate how complex logic from DAX is mirrored in SQL for validation.


Two Distinct Views:

Standard View: Based on Policy Transaction Date.
Underwriter View: Based on Policy Written Date (when the policy was actually written).
Differences in transaction values and types (e.g., New Business, Renewals, MTAs) are clearly reflected across these views.


This dashboard combines advanced Power BI capabilities with robust SQL validation, ensuring both flexibility and reliability for sales performance analysis.

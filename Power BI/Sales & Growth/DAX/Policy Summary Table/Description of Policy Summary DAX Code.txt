This DAX code is creating a calculated table called PolicySummaryTablenew by combining multiple summarized datasets using the UNION function. Here's what it does step by step:

1. Purpose
It builds a summary table that shows policy counts and GWP (Gross Written Premium) for different transaction types (NB, RNL, MTA, MTC) for Current Year (CY) and Previous Year (PY).

2. Transaction Types

NB = New Business
RNL = Renewal
MTA = Mid-Term Adjustment
MTC = Mid-Term Cancellation


3. Structure
For each transaction type, it uses SUMMARIZE to create a row with:

Transaction Type (NB, RNL, MTA, MTC)
CY Policy Count (Current Year)
CY GWP (Current Year)
PY Policy Count (Previous Year)
PY GWP (Previous Year)


4. Logic

For NB and RNL:

Calculates policy count and GWP for CY and PY using CALCULATE + FILTER on Dim Date for the respective year.


For MTA:

Policy count is Blank() (not applicable).
GWP is sum of NB and Renewal mid-term adjustment amounts for CY and PY.


For MTC:

Policy count is sum of NB and Renewal mid-term cancellation counts for CY and PY.
GWP is sum of NB and Renewal mid-term cancellation amounts for CY and PY.
